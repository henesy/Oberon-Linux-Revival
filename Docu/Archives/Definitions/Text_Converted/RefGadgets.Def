Reference
	Create with:	Gadgets.Link RefGadgets.NewReference
	Alias:	-
	Function:	Stores a reference to any object. It may be used in combination with reference frames.
	Attributes:	-
	Links:
		Value	Reference the model is representing

Frame
	Create with:	Gadgets.Insert RefGadgets.NewFrame
	Alias:	-
	Function:	This frame stores a reference to any object of type Objects.Object. A refrence frame has the ability to execute a command when clicked on. The frame distinguish three kinds of representation;  -> no object,  -> object is a visual gadget or  -> object is a model. When the reference is changed by user interaction (dropping or copy over), it also has the ability to execute a command. References can be changed either by dropping a reference from an otherreference frame, dropping a visual gadget into a frame or copy over a selected gadget. Dragging follows the standard oberon rules. If the dragged reference represents a visual gadget, a drop messgae is sent to the receiving frame. If the dragged reference represents a model, a link message with name set to 'Model' is sent to the receiving frame. The mouse cursor changes its look;  -> drop the referenced object or  -> drop a copy of the referenced object
	Attributes:	
		Cmd	Command executed when clicking on the frame.
		ConsumeCmd	Command executed when an object is dropped or copied over.
		Locked	When set, frame refuse action 'drop', 'copy over' and 'delete'.
		Drag	Allow dragging of value.
	Links:
		Value	Reference the frame is representing
