DEFINITION MD5;	(* portable *)

(* The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm (RFC1321)

The algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces
as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input. It is
conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce two messages
having the same message digest, or to produce any message having a
given prespecified target message digest. The MD5 algorithm is intended
for digital signature applications, where a large file must be "compressed"
in a secure manner before being encrypted with a private (secret) key
under a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA. *)

	PROCEDURE WriteBytes (context: Context; VAR buf: ARRAY OF CHAR; len: LONGINT);

(* Ends an MD5 message-digest operation, writing the message digest. *)
