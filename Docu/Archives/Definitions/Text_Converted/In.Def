DEFINITION In; (* portable *)

(* Stream oriented text input. Module In encapsulates the parameter scanning process of commands. *)

	VAR 
		Done: BOOLEAN;	(* Has the last scan operation been successful? *)

(* Initializes the parameter scanner. The parameter stream is assumed to be the selection when ^ is scanned, 
the marked text viewer when * is scanned; otherwise the text that follows the command itself. *)
	PROCEDURE Open;

(* Scan a single character. The character returned is the character immediately following the last scanned token.*)
	PROCEDURE Char (VAR ch: CHAR);

(* Scan an integer. *)
	PROCEDURE Int (VAR i: INTEGER);

(* Scan a long integer. *)
	PROCEDURE LongInt (VAR i: LONGINT);

(* Scan a real number. *)
	PROCEDURE Real (VAR x: REAL);

(* Scan a long real number. *)
	PROCEDURE LongReal (VAR y: LONGREAL);

(* Scan a name. The syntax of a name is the same as that of the module Texts scanner. *)
	PROCEDURE Name (VAR name: ARRAY OF CHAR);

(* Scan a double quoted string. The quotes are not returned. *)
	PROCEDURE String (VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);

END In.

(* Remarks:

1. Module In provides a primitive interface to parameter scanning. It is mainly used in situations where the 
command parameters must appear in a predefined sequence, and for Oberon beginners. A more flexible 
means of scanning parameters is provided in the Texts module.

2. Suppose we need to program a command Example.Calculate. There are three ways of passing parameters 
to this command:

	Example.Calculate par1 par2 par3 ~	Parameters follow directly after the command.
	Example.Calculate ^	Parameters are contained in the text selection.
	Example.Calculate *	Parameters are found in the marked text viewer.
	
To hide the three parameter passing styles, we can program Example.Calculate in the following way:

	PROCEDURE Calculate*;
	VAR s: ARRAY 64 OF CHAR;
	BEGIN
		In.Open;	(* Initialize the scanner according to one of the three parameter passing styles. *)
		WHILE In.Done DO
			In.Name(s);	(* scan the next name *)
		END
	END Calculate;

After each call to an In scan procedure, the In.Done flag is set to true if a parameter of that type was found 
in the parameters. If an unexpected parameter (say an integer instead of an string) was scanned, In.Done is 
set to FALSE and scanning is immediately terminated. Calls to In will now have no effect until In.Open is called again.

3. The parameter scanner ignores whitespace (characters SPACE 20X, TAB 9X, and CR 0DX).
